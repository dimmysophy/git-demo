# Demo Git repository

This is the first trial in the repo

## Ipsum Below
I like this new skill called using git fromthe scratch that i am currently doing. Dont get mme wrong, i have been using git but i have not tried using it from the scratch like this before. I would normally just breeze in use git and just leave. we dont normally understand each other we rather just use eachother.
